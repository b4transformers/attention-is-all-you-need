Details of dose rate of "Fugen Power Plant" can be calculated by using DERS software.
The changes of conditions for computation of the dose rate, namely, object changes, are inputted to DERS from VRdose software by using a special marker.
Responding to these changes DERS can compute new dose rate.
The characteristics of R5 version of this software, instruction manual, and design document were summarized.
Here was developed a phase shift magnetic sensor system composed of two sets of coils, amplifiers, and phase shifts for sensing and output.
This is a feedback circuit shifting resonance frequency by chang of input signal phase, which can detect change of magnetic features of an object present at a center of two coils on high sensitivity and resolution.
For the coils, here were used two coils with 6mm of inner diameter and 800 of coil number by inversely connecting.
On a test, it was possible to analyze features of city water, pure water, city water treated by magnetized device by changing frequency.
And, it was confirmed to enable also to detect change of flow rate and volume.
Here was described a high sensitivity strain sensor using the surface acoustic waves (SAW) for radio frequency IC tag (RFID) and sensor network, to numerically discuss a strain testing meathod observing SAW resonant fequency (SAW-RF) shifts caused by the strain.
