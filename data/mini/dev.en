In information technology and electron field,the application of nanotechnology to next generation semiconductors,high-density information record technology,miniature integrated circuit elements,electric power saving displays using carbon nano-tube,etc. can be expected.
In medical treatment and welfare field,the application to biosensors and the micromachine which administer the medicines to the lesion,etc. can be expected.
In environment and energy field,polyelectrolyte for batteries,minute catalyst with high reactivity,the development of new materials utilized for pollutant removal and fuel-cell vehicle are considered.
It is useful as generic technology such as the measurement of the ultra-high accuracy.
A high sensitive small‚Äêsized power pressure sensor which performas consistent linearity was fabricated by incorporating two semiconductor gages so that the measurement is stabilized.
By using a conventional sensor, only averaged powder pressure on the bottom of a container is measured, however by using this sensor, a pressure distribution can be measured to allow the understanding of detail of a mechanism.
It can be sufficiently used for measurement of dynamic pressure such as pressure change on the wall surface when powder is discharged from a silo and impact response in a mass of powder.
This paper also describes the production procedure of this pressure gage.
The subsidy for research of the foundation in 1995 fiscal year was 228.3 million yen in total for 138 items.
Meetings for announcing research results were held in Japan and abroad.
